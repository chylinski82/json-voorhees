# JSON Voorhees

JSON Voorhees is my first fully independent React project, created to interact with [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), an API that allows users to practice handling HTTP requests. JSON Voorhees groups data from jsonplaceholder into todos, posts, and photos.

## Overview

With JSON Voorhees, users can browse, edit, and delete items, as well as search for data. Please note that this app is not responsive and may not look good on small devices, as it was made specifically for desktop and is more of a React practice tool.

## Installation

To use JSON Voorhees, simply go [there](http://json-voorhees.surge.sh) and play with the user interface.

## Usage

Use the buttons and forms provided in the user interface to browse, edit, delete, and search for data.

## Known Issues

The app is not responsive and may not look good on small devices.

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute with your responsive styles and any other ideas to improve this project. You can [contact the project maintainer](mailto:k.chylinski82@gmail.com) for more information.
